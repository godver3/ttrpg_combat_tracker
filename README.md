### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Docker and Docker Compose installed on your system.

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

### Building and Running with Docker Compose

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ttrpg-combat-tracker.git
   cd ttrpg-combat-tracker```

2. Build and run the application using Docker Compose:

   ```docker-compose up --build```

## Note

I built this project out of personal interest using almost exclusively generative AI tools. I found it extremely interested and learned quite a bit about nodeJS along the way.

This will build the Docker images and start the application. The application
will be accessible on port 4006.
